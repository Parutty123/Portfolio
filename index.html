      <h1>Hi, I am Parvana</h1>
      <p>
        A passionate student and aspiring web developer.
  
        I'm currently learning the foundations of web design and development,
        and I love exploring how code can bring creative ideas to life.
  
        With every project, I aim to grow my skills, experiment with new technologies,
        and build things that are both useful and visually engaging. This portfolio is a
        glimpse into my learning journey — and just the beginning!

      <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> I am a student of 10th std.I feel developing is an interesting aspect. I enjoy designing. I have completed HTML
          and CSS and am currently completing JavaScript.
      Even at this early stage in my journey, I’ve already started exploring the world of coding and design, building websites, and learning how to bring ideas to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
     
     
       I believe in learning by doing, and every project I create helps me grow a little more. Whether it's crafting clean user interfaces or experimenting with cool hover effects, I love turning creative thoughts into functional, beautiful web experiences.
    
     
       I'm constantly exploring new technologies and improving my skills every day. This portfolio is just the beginning — I’m excited to see where this path takes me!

      <h1>My experience with Steyp</h1>
      <p>I joined Steyp through a program introduced by my school.
      The “Tech@school” programme gave me and my friends an opportunity to learn more about technology.
      I’ve improved my coding abilities, explored new tools, and grown a lot.
      I’ve learned how websites are created and much more.
      At first, I found JavaScript difficult, but now I’m catching up.
      I’ve been introduced to many new concepts I never knew before</p>
